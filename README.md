# Project-IntroML
This is a simple speech recognition system implemented as the course project of Intro to Machine Learning.

We implemented a Hidden Markov Model here to model the time-varying process of producing speech.

Dataset includes folders for training and testing samples. One can load these samples using TRAIN.transcripts and TEST.transcripts, which contains words of digits spoken in the corresponding audio files specified by the name at the end of each line.
